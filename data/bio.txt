## Projects

### Transformer Based TTS System
I implemented and optimized a Transformer based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model using the LJSpeech dataset and the SpeechBrain framework. By applying scaled positional encodings, teacher forcing, and weighted loss functions for Mel spectrogram predictions and stop token accuracy, I significantly enhanced speech synthesis capabilities. These enhancements led to a marked improvement in natural speech synthesis, reducing Mel Error to 8.27e-03 and Stop Error by over 10%. Additionally, I utilized dynamic batching for varied input lengths and applied the Noam Scheduler and Optimizer Initialization technique for dynamic learning rate adjustments and fine-tuning, achieving training speeds up to 3.5 times faster than Tacotron2.

### Dialogue Summarization: Fine Tuning LLM using Prompt Engineering and PEFT
In this project, I explored the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face to summarize dialogue. I employed prompt engineering to refine the quality of the summaries and experimented with zero-shot/few-shot inference and prompt formats to boost the model’s in-context learning and performance. By fine-tuning the model using the PEFT method—Low Rank Adaptation, I achieved a substantial reduction in model size by over 95% while maintaining competitive performance metrics, evidenced by a 17.47% and 8.73% improvement in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores over human baseline summaries.

### Automated Retail Product Classification using CNN
I implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using ResNet-18, GoogleNet, and AlexNet on three different datasets for classifying grocery products. I addressed challenges like imbalanced data and vanishing gradients and conducted hyperparameter tuning using grid search to ensure optimal model configurations for superior performance. By fine-tuning models using transfer learning on the weights of the best-performing model (ResNet-18), I achieved high performance and performed bias analysis to understand the nuances in different models.

### Multi-task Modeling on Handwritten Digits using Keras
In this project, I performed simultaneous tasks on grayscale digits: predicting digit value and color. I designed a data generator function that generates red and green color images using the grayscale MNIST images dataset from Keras. I developed a ResNet-style architecture with skip connections for a multi-tasking neural network model, achieving a remarkable 98% accuracy for digit and color recognition using interconnected neural networks.

### Modeling Wine Quality using Ensemble Modeling Approach
I employed ensemble modeling techniques on a wine dataset to predict wine quality scores based on chemical properties and expert wine taster evaluations. I utilized bagging techniques to build predictive models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Ada Boost, and XG Boost. With the XG Boost algorithm, I achieved superior prediction accuracy of 89%, contributing to enhanced wine quality assessment and analysis.

### Skin Disease Identification using Image Analysis
I developed a CNN model with OpenCV integration for streamlined image analysis, enhancing model generalization by innovating a custom data preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch. I employed Max-Pooling, Flatten, and Conv2D neural network layers for robust real-time skin disease detection. The model was deployed via Flask, creating an efficient and user-friendly application for skin disease identification.
